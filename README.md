# Emitter Party

An exploration of the undocumented `CAEmitterBehavior`, heavily inspired by blog post https://bryce.co/caemitterbehavior/.

The app also explores some undocumented behavior of `CAEmitterCell`, specifically the `particleType`.
There isn't (yet) any way to export the animations, but tweaking the parameters should give you a very good idea on how to implement this in your own app.
